Instructions for Project 2:

1. Run the following commands to compile the 3 algorithmic programs:
	make changeslow
	make changegreedy
	make changedp

2. Each program takes the following input in a .txt file:
	-an array of denominations, like [1, 5, 10, 25] where the denominations are standard USA coinage.
	-a value of change which we are trying to make using the least number of coins-- say 100, which is equal to $1.

3. To read the text file into the program, enter the command as follows:
	changedp coin1.txt
	Where coin1.txt is the text file with the values as noted above.

4. The program will automatically tell you approximately how long it took to run on the command line.
	The results will be put into a text file named _____change.txt. So if you use coin1.txt, the results will be coin1change.txt.
